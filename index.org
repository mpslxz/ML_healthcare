*Artificial Intelligence:*
- The ability to build intelligent machines and computer programs, which can do analysis, reasoning, planning and inference in various situations.
  + Human-like AI: Perform tasks like //humans// i.e., model the thought process.
  + Rational-like AI: Achieve goals with predefined measures i.e., model the outcome.

The process of extracting //_patterns_// from a //_dataset_// using //_statistical_// models.
{{{NEWLINE}}}
- Tasks
  - Supervised: building a model with *{{{color(green,complete feedback)}}}* from an expert (High accuracy, low scalability)
  - Semi-supervised: a model with *{{{color(yellow,partial feedback)}}}* from an expert (Med. accuracy, med. scalability)
  - Unsupervised: *{{{color(red, No feedback)}}}* is given during learning (Low accuracy, high scalability)
  - Reinforcement learning: a model _interacts_ with an environment and gets reward or penalty (requires lots and lots of data).
- The feedback is often given as a set of targets for each sample in the dataset.
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

* Essentials of traditional ML
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- A //_fair_// dataset.
- Tools and methods, which highligh attributes that are relevant to the task, e.g., edges of an image for simplifying shapes or keywords from a text document. These are called //_feature extractors_//
- A mathematical model that correlates the combination of features to the task.
- An algorithm that rewards the model when it is accurate and penalizes it, otherwise. This is called the "training algorithm".
- Example: Regression problem{{{NEWLINE}}} [[./assets/housing.png]]
** A few well-known problem categories
{{{NEWLINE}}}
- Regression: The predicted values are continuous, e.g., housing prices (supervised).
{{{NEWLINE}}}
- Classification: The predicted values are categorical, e.g., is it raining now? (supervised)
{{{NEWLINE}}}
- Clustering: Grouping the data based on significant differences and similarities between samples, a.k.a structures, e.g., summarization (unsupervised).
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
A mathematical framework that is inspired by the biological neural networks.
- An artificial neuron processes an input signal and passes it to the others.
- Each neuron is connected to the others via a set of {{{color(gree, weights)}}}, which are real numbers.
- The synapic connections are modeled by summation, followed by a pre-defined non-linear function, called {{{color(gree, activation)}}}.
- The goal of the training algorithm is to {{{color(red, adjust)}}} the weights such that the model's predictions are accurate for all of the samples in the dataset.

** Performance vs. Data (from Andrew Ng)
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 90%
[[./assets/curves.png]]

** Validation
- Divide the dataset into 3 groups: train, validation, test.
  - Use train set for training the model.
  - Use validation set to see how it would perform on "simulated" real data.
  - Use test set for approximation of the real accuracy.
  - Analyze the error rates.
    1. High training error?
    2. High validation error?
    3. High test error?
{{{NEWLINE}}}
- The model should not see the test set during training. (why?)

** Gold standard
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Q: Ultimately, a model wants to reach the performance of humans, but how do you define //{{{color(yellow, human level performance)}}}//, e.g., in medical image interpretation?
  - Typical person?
  - Typical doctor?
  - expert doctor?
  - team of expert doctors?

- A: Team of expert doctors.
  - Lowest _error_ and _inter-observer variability_
  - High cost
* Deep learning
- If there is "unlimited" amounts of data and processing power with "unlimited" memory, there is no need to write programs to extract patterns in the data.
  - No need for feature extractors anymore!
- Instead, a complex model with a large parameter set can automatically learn _what features are useful_.

- Multiple layers of non-linear abstraction is a key feature of deep models.
